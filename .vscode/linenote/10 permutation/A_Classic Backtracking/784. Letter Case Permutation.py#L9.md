Clarify Constraints

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 12`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters, uppercase English letters, and digits.

What’s the maximum length of the string?”

“Are there only letters and digits?”

“Do we need the results in a specific order?”

Baseline Solution

> “A straightforward approach would be to generate all possible combinations using backtracking.”
>
> - 如果是字母 → 2 choices
> - 如果是数字 → 1 choice

Core Idea

he key observation is that each letter gives us two branches, while digits give only one.”

“Edge cases:

- If the string is empty, the result should be `[""]` in general, but this problem usually assumes non-empty input — I’ll follow the spec.
- If there are no letters, like `“123”`, we should return just one string.
- If there’s only one letter, like `“a”`, we return `["a","A"]`.”

Complexity

“Time complexity is O(2^k), where k is the number of letters, because each letter doubles the number of possibilities.”

all letter,

Space complexity is O(n) for recursion depth, and O(2^k \* n) for storing the output.” two to the k times n
